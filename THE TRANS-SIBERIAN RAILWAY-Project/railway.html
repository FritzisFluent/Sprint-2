              Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Izhevsk, Moscow — 18 days en route in
              total. This is how musician David Bowie traveled to Europe after
              his tour of Japan in the spring of 1973. Bowie had a fear of
              flying, so he took the train.

              First, you see the familiar landscapes of the European part of
              Russia: fields, cottages, villages, woods, and power lines. It
              feels almost like travelling through the land of the hobbits, or
              into the past, back to 1973; if feels like David Bowie could walk
              in from the next compartment at any moment wearing a Japanese
              kimono and bright pants.

              It's time to get into your element. In Kostroma, you get off the
              train and buy all the things you forgot to pack: instant coffee,
              instant noodles, and a six pack of beer. Now make yourself
              comfortable. We're not even halfway there yet.

              Your journey has transcended the physical realm and moved into the
              spiritual. This mystical experince of immersing yourself in the
              depths of Russia's soul will stay with you forever. Europe is far
              behind, and Asia is still lightyears away. You may even have been
              stationary this whole time. You've lost the count of how many
              miles you've traveled, and now you're not even sure if train is
              moving at all. On the other hand, if you look out the window for a
              long time (to be honest, there's not much else to do), you can see
              ancient mammoths of past millenia wandering these plains.

              You're now at the very heart of the continent, and there's no sign
              of either ancient civilizations, or of Europe and Asia. Here the
              train passes through the highest point of the Trans-Siberian
              Railway, and the path to the sea begins. Before, the road narrowed
              here to one track and went through a tiny tunnel, the entrance to
              which was adorned with a sign pointing you towards the great
              ocean.

              You're starting to think you'll most likely spend the rest of your
              life in the train when Khabarovsk appears on the horizon. You
              already know more about your fellow passengers than about your
              family members. Anyway, only some 800 kilometers more to go, and
              you'll be arriving in Vladivostok.

              This has been an extraordinary journey. Everyone has their very
